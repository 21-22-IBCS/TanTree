\f0\fs24 \cf0 The Yellow Wallpaper\
\
By Charlotte Perkins Gilman\
\
\
It is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure\
ancestral halls for the summer.\
\
A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house,\
and reach the height of romantic felicity\'97but that would be asking too\
much of fate!\
\
Still I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.\
\
Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long\
untenanted?\
\
John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.\
\
John is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an\
intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of\
things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.\
\
John is a physician, and perhaps\'97(I would not say it to a living soul,\
of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my\
mind)\'97perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster.\
\
You see, he does not believe I am sick!\
\
And what can one do?\
\
If a physician of high standing, and one\'92s own husband, assures friends\
and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but\
temporary nervous depression\'97a slight hysterical tendency\'97what is one\
to do?\
